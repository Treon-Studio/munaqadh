# Munaqadh RESTful API Backend

[![GoDoc Badge]][godoc] [![GoReportCard Badge]][goreportcard]

Easily extendible RESTful API boilerplate aiming to follow idiomatic go and best practice.

The goal of this boiler is to have a solid and structured foundation to build upon on.

Any feedback and pull requests are welcome and highly appreciated. Feel free to open issues just for comments and discussions.

## Features

The following feature set is a minimal selection of typical Web API requirements:

- Configuration using [viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper)
- CLI features using [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)
- PostgreSQL support including migrations using [bun](https://github.com/uptrace/bun)
- Structured logging with [Logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus)
- Routing with [chi router](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) and middleware, following [chi rest example](https://github.com/go-chi/chi/tree/master/_examples/rest)
- JWT Authentication using [lestrrat-go/jwx](https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx) with example passwordless email authentication
- Request data validation using [ozzo-validation](https://github.com/go-ozzo/ozzo-validation)
- HTML emails with [go-mail](https://github.com/go-mail/mail)

## Start Application

- Clone and change into this repository

### Local

- Create a postgres database and adjust environment variables in dev.env
- Run the application to see available commands: `go run main.go`
- Run all migrations from database/migrate folder: `go run main.go migrate`
- Run the application with command _serve_: `go run main.go serve`

### Using Docker Compose

- First start the database only: `docker compose up -d postgres`
- Once initialize the database by running all migrations in database/migrate folder: `docker compose run server ./main migrate`
- Start the api server: `docker compose up`

### Environment Variables

By default viper will look at dev.env for a config file. It contains the applications defaults if no environment variables are set otherwise.

## API Routes

### Authentication

For passwordless login following routes are available:

| Path          | Method | Required JSON | Header                                | Description                                                             |
| ------------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| /auth/login   | POST   | email         |                                       | the email you want to login with (see below)                            |
| /auth/token   | POST   | token         |                                       | the token you received via email (or printed to stdout if smtp not set) |
| /auth/refresh | POST   |               | Authorization: "Bearer refresh_token" | refresh JWTs                                                            |
| /auth/logout  | POST   |               | Authorizaiton: "Bearer refresh_token" | logout from this device                                                 |

Outgoing emails containing the login token will be printed to stdout if no valid email smtp settings are provided by environment variables (see dev.env). If _EMAIL_SMTP_HOST_ is set but the host can not be reached the application will exit immediately at start.

### Example API

The example api follows the patterns from the [chi rest example](https://github.com/go-chi/chi/tree/master/_examples/rest). Besides _/auth_ routes the API provides two main routes for _/api_ and _/admin_ requests, the latter requires to be logged in as administrator by providing the respective JWT in Authorization Header.

Check [routes.md](routes.md) for a generated overview of the provided API routes.

### Testing

Package auth/pwdless contains example api tests using a mocked database. Run them with: `go test -v ./...`

### Client API Access and CORS

The server is configured to serve a Progressive Web App (PWA) client from _./public_ folder (this repo only serves an example index.html, see below for a demo PWA client to put here). In this case enabling CORS is not required, because the client is served from the same host as the api.

If you want to access the api from a client that is served from a different host, including e.g. a development live reloading server with below demo client, you must enable CORS on the server first by setting environment variable _ENABLE_CORS=true_ on the server to allow api connections from clients served by other hosts.

#### Demo client application

A deployed demo version can also be found at [https://go-base.leapcell.app/](https://go-base.leapcell.app/)

For demonstration of the login and account management features this API serves a demo [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) PWA. It's source code can be found [here](https://github.com/dhax/go-base-vue). You can build and put it into the api's _./public_ folder, or use the live development server (requires ENABLE_CORS environment variable set to true).

Use one of the following bootstrapped users for login:

- <admin@example.com> (has access to admin panel)
- <user@example.com>
